# Design Choices - TG E-Commerce System

This document outlines the architectural decisions, technology choices, and design patterns implemented in the TG E-Commerce System, along with the rationale behind each decision.

## Architectural Patterns

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Decision:** Implemented Domain-Driven Design as the core architectural approach.

**Rationale:** E-commerce projects are inherently complex business domains with intricate relationships between entities like products, categories, orders, customers, and inventory. DDD provides several key benefits for this context:

- **Complex Business Logic Management**: E-commerce systems contain sophisticated business rules (pricing strategies, inventory management, order processing workflows) that benefit from being encapsulated within domain entities
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Enables clear communication between business stakeholders and developers using domain-specific terminology
- **Bounded Contexts**: Allows for proper separation of different business areas (catalog management, order processing, customer management) as the system scales
- **Domain Events**: Critical for e-commerce systems where actions in one area trigger cascading effects (order placement affecting inventory, payment processing triggering fulfillment)
- **Scalability Preparation**: As e-commerce platforms grow, DDD's modular approach facilitates breaking the system into microservices along domain boundaries

### Clean Architecture

**Decision:** Structured the solution using Clean Architecture principles with clear layer separation.

**Rationale:** 
- **Dependency Inversion**: Core business logic remains independent of external concerns (databases, web frameworks, third-party services)
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation, crucial for e-commerce systems where business logic correctness is paramount
- **Technology Independence**: Ability to change databases, web frameworks, or external services without affecting business rules
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and modify as business requirements evolve

## Technology Choices

### Configuration Management - HashiCorp Vault

**Decision:** Used HashiCorp Vault for configuration and secrets management instead of appsettings.json.

**Rationale:** 
- **Dynamic Configuration Management**: Unlike static appsettings files, Vault allows for runtime configuration changes without application restarts
- **Security**: Sensitive information like database connection strings are encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Audit Trail**: All access to secrets is logged, providing compliance and security monitoring capabilities
- **Environment Separation**: Different environments (dev, staging, prod) can have separate secret stores while maintaining the same application code
- **Centralized Management**: In a microservices architecture, Vault provides centralized secret management across all services

### Database - PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core

**Decision:** Selected PostgreSQL as the primary database with Entity Framework Core as the ORM.

**Rationale:**
- **ACID Compliance**: E-commerce systems require strong consistency, especially for financial transactions and inventory management
- **JSON Support**: PostgreSQL's native JSON capabilities are valuable for handling product catalogs with varying attributes
- **Performance**: Excellent performance characteristics for both OLTP and analytical workloads
- **Open Source**: No licensing costs, important for cost-sensitive e-commerce operations
- **Extensibility**: Rich ecosystem of extensions for full-text search, geographic data, and other e-commerce-relevant features

### Design Patterns

#### CQRS with MediatR

**Decision:** Implemented Command Query Responsibility Segregation using the MediatR library.

**Rationale:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Commands and queries have different performance and complexity requirements in e-commerce systems
- **Scalability**: Enables independent scaling of read and write operations, crucial for high-traffic e-commerce platforms
- **Code Organization**: Keeps request handlers focused and testable
- **Pipeline Behaviors**: Provides a clean way to implement cross-cutting concerns like validation, logging, and exception handling

#### Repository Pattern with Specification Pattern

**Decision:** Implemented Repository pattern enhanced with Specification pattern using Ardalis.Specification.

**Rationale:**
- **Data Access Abstraction**: Repository pattern abstracts the data layer, making it easier to test and potentially swap data sources
- **Query Reusability**: Specification pattern allows for composable, reusable query logic
- **Complex Filtering**: E-commerce systems require sophisticated filtering and searching capabilities that specifications handle elegantly
- **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed specifications prevent runtime query errors

#### Unit of Work Pattern

**Decision:** Implemented Unit of Work pattern for transaction management.

**Rationale:**
- **Transaction Management**: E-commerce operations often involve multiple entity changes that must be atomic
- **Performance Optimization**: Batching database operations reduces the number of database round trips
- **Domain Events**: Provides a clean integration point for dispatching domain events after successful persistence

### Validation - FluentValidation

**Decision:** Used FluentValidation library for input validation.

**Rationale:**
- **Expressive Syntax**: More readable and maintainable than data annotations
- **Complex Validation Rules**: E-commerce systems often have intricate business rules that FluentValidation handles better than simple attribute-based validation
- **Testability**: Validation rules can be unit tested independently
- **Localization Support**: Important for international e-commerce platforms

### Error Handling - ProblemDetails with Custom Exception Handling

**Decision:** Implemented comprehensive error handling using ProblemDetails standard with custom exception handlers.

**Rationale:**
- **Standardization**: ProblemDetails provides a standard format for API error responses
- **Client Integration**: Consistent error format makes client application integration easier
- **Debugging Support**: Detailed error information in development while maintaining security in production
- **Exception Classification**: Different exception types (domain, validation, application) are handled appropriately

### Logging - Microsoft.Extensions.Logging with Pipeline Behaviors

**Decision:** Implemented structured logging with custom pipeline behaviors for request/response logging.

**Rationale:**
- **Observability**: Request/response logging is crucial for debugging and monitoring e-commerce transactions
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracking request processing times helps identify performance bottlenecks
- **Audit Trail**: Important for e-commerce systems to maintain logs of all operations for compliance and troubleshooting
- **Structured Data**: Structured logging enables better log analysis and monitoring dashboards

## Infrastructure Decisions

### Containerization - Docker

**Decision:** Containerized the entire application stack using Docker Compose.

**Rationale:**
- **Environment Consistency**: Eliminates "works on my machine" issues across development, testing, and production environments
- **Dependency Management**: All services and their dependencies are clearly defined and versioned
- **Scalability**: Container orchestration platforms can easily scale individual services based on demand
- **Deployment Simplicity**: Single command deployment reduces operational complexity

### Automatic Database Migrations

**Decision:** Implemented automatic database migration execution on application startup.

**Rationale:**
- **Deployment Simplification**: Reduces deployment steps and potential for human error
- **Environment Synchronization**: Ensures all environments stay synchronized with the latest database schema
- **Development Velocity**: Developers don't need to manually run migrations during development

## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Complexity vs. Maintainability
- **Trade-off**: The chosen architecture introduces more complexity compared to a simple layered architecture
- **Justification**: The complexity is justified by improved maintainability, testability, and scalability as the e-commerce platform grows

### Performance vs. Flexibility
- **Trade-off**: CQRS and multiple abstraction layers may introduce slight performance overhead
- **Justification**: The flexibility gained for complex e-commerce queries and the ability to optimize read/write operations independently outweighs the minimal overhead

### Development Speed vs. Code Quality
- **Trade-off**: Initial development is slower due to the architectural setup and patterns
- **Justification**: The investment in proper architecture pays dividends in long-term maintainability and feature development velocity

## Future Considerations

As the system scales, the current architecture provides a foundation for:

- **Microservices Migration**: Domain boundaries are clearly defined for potential service extraction
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Domain events system can evolve into a full event-sourcing or event-driven architecture
- **CQRS Evolution**: Read and write models can be completely separated with different data stores

## Conclusion

The chosen architectural patterns and technologies create a robust foundation for an e-commerce system that can handle complex business requirements while maintaining code quality, testability, and scalability. Each decision was made with consideration for both immediate development needs and long-term platform evolution.
